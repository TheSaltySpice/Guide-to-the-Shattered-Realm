In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand.

On your turn, you can move a distance up to your movement speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here.

Your movement can include [[Exploration & Movement üî∂#Jumping|jumping]], [[Exploration & Movement üî∂#Climbing|climbing]], and [[Exploration & Movement üî∂#Swimming|swimming]]. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute your entire move. However you're moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.


___
## Breaking Up Your Move
You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.

#### Moving Between Attacks
If you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks. For example, a [[Fighter|Fighter]] who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again.

#### Using Different Speeds
If you have more than one movement speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you've already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can't use the new speed during the current move.

For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because a [[Wizard|Wizard]] cast the fly spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet more.


___
## Difficult Terrain
Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked forests, treacherous staircases--the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.

Every foot of movement in difficult terrain is doubled. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.

Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.


___
## Being Prone
Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are [[Conditions ‚ú®#Prone|prone]]. You can drop prone without using any of your speed. Standing up takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to stand up. You can't stand up if you don't have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.

To move while [[Conditions ‚ú®#Prone|prone]], you must crawl or use magic such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling is doubled. 


___
## Moving Around Other Creatures
You can move through a non-hostile creature's space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature's space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature's space, whether hostile or not, is [[2. Movement and Position#Difficult Terrain|difficult terrain]] for you.

Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can't willingly end your move in its space.

If you leave a hostile creature's reach during your move, you provoke an [[./4. Making an Attack#Opportunity Attacks|opportunity attack]].

#### Overrun
When a creature tries to move through a hostile creature‚Äôs space, the mover can try to force its way through by overrunning the hostile creature. As an bonus action, the mover makes a Strength ([[Abilities & Skills üìå#Athletics|Athletics]]) check contested by the hostile creature‚Äôs Strength check. The creature attempting the overrun has advantage on this check if it is larger than the hostile creature, or disadvantage if it is smaller. If the mover wins the contest, it can move through the hostile creature‚Äôs space once this turn.

#### Tumble
A creature can try to tumble through a hostile creature‚Äôs space, ducking and weaving past the opponent. As a bonus action, the tumbler makes a Dexterity ([[Abilities & Skills üìå#Acrobatics|Acrobatics]]) check contested by the hostile creature‚Äôs Dexterity check. The creature attempting the tumble has advantage on this check if it is smaller than the hostile creature, or disadvantage if it is larger. If the tumbler wins the contest, it can move through the hostile creature‚Äôs space once this turn.


___
## Flying Movement
Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also deal with the danger of [[Exploration & Movement üî∂#Falling|falling]]. If a flying creature is knocked [[Conditions ‚ú®#Prone|prone]], has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature [[Exploration & Movement üî∂#Falling|falls]], unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by magic, such as by the [[Arcane Spells üìå#Fly|fly]] spell.

A flying creature can end its turn in the air if it flies at least half its speed during its turn. 


___
## Creature Size
Each creature takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories.

| Size       | Space                  |
| ---------- | ---------------------- |
| Tiny       | 2 1/2 by 2 1/2 ft.     |
| Small      | 5 by 5 ft.             |
| Medium     | 5 by 5 ft.             |
| Large      | 10 by 10 ft.           |
| Huge       | 15 by 15 ft.           |
| Gargantuan | 20 by 20 ft. or larger |

#### Space
A creature's space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn't 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5‚Äêfoot-wide doorway, other creatures can't get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.

#### Climbing onto a Bigger Creature
If a creature wants to jump and hold onto a creature that is at least two sizes larger than it, the smaller creature can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check contested by the target‚Äôs Dexterity check. If it wins the contest, the smaller creature successfully moves into the target creature‚Äôs space and clings to its body. While on the target‚Äôs space, the smaller creature moves with the target and has advantage on attack rolls against it.

The smaller creature can move around within the larger creature‚Äôs space, treating the space as difficult terrain. The larger creature‚Äôs ability to attack the smaller creature depends on the smaller creature‚Äôs location, and is left to the DM's discretion. The larger creature can dislodge the smaller creature as an action‚Äîknocking it off, scraping it against a wall, or grabbing and throwing it‚Äîby making a Strength check contested by the smaller creature‚Äôs Strength or Dexterity check. The smaller creature chooses which ability to use.

#### Squeezing into a Smaller Space
A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that's only 5 feet wide. While a creatures squeezes through a space, movement is treated as [[2. Movement and Position#Difficult Terrain|difficult terrain]], and the creature has [[Abilities & Skills üìå#Advantage & Disadvantage|disadvantage]] on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it's in the smaller space.
