When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise.

When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the DM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.

___
## Attack
The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.

With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack.

Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the [[Fighter|Fighter]], allow you to make more than one attack with this action.


## Cast a Spell
Spellcasters have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell.

Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell. See chapter 8 for the rules on [[Spellcasting ‚ùå|spellcasting]].


## Dash
When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.

Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.


## Disengage
If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn‚Äôt provoke [[./4. Making an Attack#Opportunity Attacks|opportunity attacks]] for the rest of the turn.


## Dodge
When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has [[Abilities & Skills üìå#Advantage & Disadvantage|disadvantage]] if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with [[Abilities & Skills üìå#Advantage & Disadvantage|advantage]]. You lose this benefit if your speed drops to 0 for any reason.


## Escape 
A [[Conditions ‚ú®#Restrained|restrained]] creature can use its action to attempt escape from a grapple or restraint. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity check (creature's choice) check against the escape DC of the source of it's restraint.

If the source of restraint is a creature, the following formula is used to determine the escape DC.
Escape DC = 8 + [[Levels & Proficiency Bonus#Proficiency Bonus|proficiency bonus]] of the restraining creature + strength modifier of the restraint.

If the source of restraint is a spell or magical effect, the Escape DC is equal to the spellcasting DC of the source of restraint. If the source of restraint is an object, refer to the object's description to determine its Escape DC.

If an outside force attempts to end a restraint, such as when a creature is hurled away by the [[Occult Spells üìå#Thunderwave|thunderwave]] spell, or a creature tries to pull and ally from the grasp of a enemy using the [[3. Actions in Combat#Help|help]] action, the restrained creature may use their reaction to attempt an escape check at advantage. 


## Help
You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn. In order to help a creature in this way, you must have proficiency with the skill or tool you are attempting to help with.

Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally‚Äôs attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, its attack rolls are made with advantage for that turn.


## Hide
When you take the Hide action, you make a [[Abilities & Skills üìå#Stealth|Stealth]] check in an attempt to [[Exploration & Movement üî∂#Hiding|hide]]. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described under the [[./4. Making an Attack#Unseen Attackers and Targets|Unseen Attackers and Targets]] section later in this chapter.


## Ready
Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.

First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it.

When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger.

When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell‚Äôs magic requires [[Spellcasting ‚ùå#Concentration|concentration]]. If your [[Spellcasting ‚ùå#Concentration|concentration]] is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. 


## Skill Check
Using your action, you can perform any kind of check using a [[Abilities & Skills üìå#Skills|skill]], [[Tools & Sets#Tool Sets|tool]] or other proficiency you have. When you take the Skill Check action, inform the DM of what you'd like you do, and the DM will set a DC. This action could be used to search for an object in the heat of battle, intuit a creature's next action, or identify a spell being cast; these are just a few examples, there is no limit to what you may choose to do.


## Use an Object
You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action.
